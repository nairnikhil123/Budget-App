# Budget-App
This is my first project involving javascrpit.
This app shows, the balance, the income and the outcome. it also has a dashboard where the user can add a new entry (an income or an expense), user can toggle between the income list (that show only all income entries) and the expenses list (that shows only the outcome entries) and all list that shows all the entries. 
The user can edit or delete an entry. 
Our app has a chart, so the user can easily compare the income and outcome.
The user's income and expense entry list is stored in the local storage, so when he/she refreshes the page, or reboot his/her machine, they can always find their data there.
